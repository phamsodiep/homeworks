NOTES

THIS IS MY HOMEWORK DOING, PLEASE CONSULT THE SUB-FOLDER "LICENSE" FILE FOR
DETAILS LICENSE. THERE ARE SOME NOTES:

1. I did my homework by a tutorial of another author (via github, youtube...)
so the owner of my homework doing is not only me but the author also for 
each sub-folder.

2. Please go to the tutorial websites for instructions. You also could subscribe
or click a like for author if you love the tutorial. There is no instructions
cloned or copied in this repository.

3. If you use this repository for learning purpose only, it is ok for you do not
care the license because the tutorial is designed for that purpose, otherwise,
please consult the sub-folder license file for link to author tutorial.

4. Feel free to use my outcome with MIT License if you get a license from the
author of the tutorial.
